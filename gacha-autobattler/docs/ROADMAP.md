## Development Principles

1. **Ship incrementally:** Each version should be playable and testable
2. **Polish before features:** A polished small game beats a buggy big one
3. **Test on target platform:** Regular Windows builds for testing
4. **Player feedback:** Incorporate feedback between versions
5. **Keep scope manageable:** Better to release 1.0 than chase perfection
